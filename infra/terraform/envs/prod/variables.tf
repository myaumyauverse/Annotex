    Additional hostnames that 301-redirect to var.domain rather than serving the

    Keeping exactly one origin is not cosmetic: CORS_ORIGIN is a single value
    derived from var.domain, so a browser left on a second origin while running
    a bundle that calls the canonical one has its API requests blocked.

    Each name is added to the certificate as well, so each must already resolve
    to the Elastic IP before apply — certbot validates every -d over HTTP-01.
